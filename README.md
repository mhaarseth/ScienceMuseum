Semester project at Noroff.

## Description

We were assigned to make a web page for a fictional science museum. We had to presents the museums exhibitions, oppurtunities for getting involved etc.

I wanted the site to be colorful and informative, making the visitors curious and eager to visit. The use of color was inspired by the image of the front of the museum (we were supplied with all the asstes).

As we had not been taught JS at that point in our course, there is no functionality, and the form does not function and does not include any form of validation.
