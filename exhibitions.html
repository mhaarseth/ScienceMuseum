                    <p>
                        On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam,
                        the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science
                        Museum. It's a series of installations that allow visitors to
                        experience the power of the elements as we harness them.

                    <p>
                        From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows
                        how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exhibition can be seen all through june, july and august.

                    <p>
                        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
                        question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we
                        get here? Since Darwin proposed vhis theory of evolution we hav
                         had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in
                        this world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
                        know today have evolved our time. You can also take some
                        time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
                        Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                        dinosaurs too.

                    <p>
                        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                        biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
                        the tiny world.

                    <p>
                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
                        of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
                        medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
                        take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
                        penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
                        but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures
                        have beat us to it.

                    <p>
                        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
                        planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
                        create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
                        whole planet.

                    <p>
                        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
                        currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and
                        pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute
                        to a brighter future.
